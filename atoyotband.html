<h3>Meet Ellen!</h3>
<p>Cordisco crafts intentional drum sounds taking inspiration from the year of each new model of Corolla. The lofi tones of the drums sound great in the Corolla’s low quality sound system.
</p>
    <h3>Meet Bri!</h3>
    <p>From Normal, Illinois, Bri is the synth player for Atoyat. Learned to play on a melodica. Synth designer, all done on a V6 motor. Modular effects on each cylinder. Specializes in 2000’s models. Drives a Honda Civic.</p>

    <h3>Meet Mathis!</h3>
      <p>Origins unknown: He may or may not have been conceived in the back of a Toyota Corolla.
        Mathis is the bass player of Atoyot. He doesn’t actually care about driving a Toyota Corolla, just likes the name because he tripped too hard on acid a few years ago and from that point he started dreaming 5 nights out of 7 about Toyota Corollas. His drug dealer also happens to be driving a Toyota Corolla.
        The ironic part is that he doesn't know how to drive. But he likes bass. Sometimes he takes a guitar and removes the two highest strings and calls it bass. Very passionate about his role in the band.
