FINAL PROJECT WEBSITE DOCUMENTATION

[link for website](https://matdb69420.github.io/Final%20proj/index.html)

Objectives:

- Build a website that was used for this final project, as well as for my Capstone Final Project.

- Generate code myself using HTLM basics learned in class, as well as HTML and CSS information and examples available on the Internet. The idea was to build a website from scratch and not to use already built templates and frameworks available.

- Use CSS to style my HTML pages and have a look and feel that represents me as an artist.

Environment:
I used GitHub as as my working environment to build HTML files, store and manage code and publish the website.

Main concept for the website:

Minimalist menu with four sections: 
- Home
- About Mathis 
- The Last Waltz Show (the concept of my last show)
- The Inteview (an interview about my Berklee Journey)

Code used:
I created four .html files (index.html for home page, and section-related distinct files).

Using CSS style, I used background images covering the entire background of each page and included a filter: grayscale (90%) to convert the images to a black and white look and feel. 

For the navigation menu, it needed to be minimalist and positioned to the left so that it does not hide the full background images.  

Each active menu section is programmed to be shown in black. Hovering the mouse over non active sections turns the color from white to grey.   

For the body, I have used various Div style classes to alternate the color in each of the different content blocks. I am also using opacity to give transparency in each block so the background images can somewhat be seen.

I had a lot of audio visual material content to integrate: images, audio files (.mp4) from the Interview, Videos from youtube and links from the Internet.

I included some Javascript to integrate social media icons (Youtube and Instagram) on my About Mathis page which are linking to my artist pages.

I used the q tag to define all quote paragraphs.

Challenges encountered:

- The display of the inline blocks for the presentation of the six musicians in the section The Last Waltz. I had (tlw_show.html file)  

- If I run the website using Safari browser, the audio files don't seem to be working, and some of the color in the section of The Last Waltz and the Interview section for the background image is not in black and white, compared to the first two sections of the site. Every other main web browser that I tested the website on (Firefox, Chrome, Edge) seemed to work just fine. I understood that every browser renders default web differently.
