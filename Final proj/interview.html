    <h2>How connections through Berklee influenced my artistry and performance experience</h2>

    <p><q>Connections through classmates was a very important thing and it really enhanced my experience playing with different people and seeing what their ideas are and how they direct things in the band and just how band dynamics are.</q></p>
 
    <p>A solid connection through a classmate led Mathis to perform with his band the <i>Bubbleheads</i> in Saint-Louis, and with <i>Josephine Glass</i> in both New York City and Los Angeles.</p>

    <p><q>The teachers were also important... Lyle [Brewer] and Colin Sapp as well, teachers they don't always have a teacher to student relationship. You can kind of become friends with them and they can confide good information to you about just tips on how to go about being a musician now and they speak from experience.</q></p>

    <h2>Music Technology concentration and pedal effects</h2>

    <p><q>As a guitar player I'm a very big fan of guitar pedals and guitar effects. I had taken a lab called Electronic Effects for Guitar... with my teacher called Colin Sapp, and with that teacher a few months after... I reached out to him and we assembled a guitar pedal together. It was an overdrive pedal and we spent the whole day soldering, and he taught me how to do that and how the circuits are made.</q></p>

    <h2>Guitarist in the <i>Tribute show to Genesis</i> directed study</h2>

    <p><q><i>Genesis</i> is not easy to play also and as an earlier semester student that gave me a lot of experience working with people that were about to graduate... and so they had some tips to give me and some just some information about music or just about life in general... But also the tribute show was very fun. It was at the end of the semester and we just weren't even mic'd up. we just brought our the drum set, we brought our amps, the keyboard player brought his laptop (MIDI) and we made it work.</q></p>

    <h2>Billy Strings and a bluegrass lab... How I got into bluegrass</h2>

    <p><q>Bluegrass is very simple harmonically. It's only 1-4-5 chords, but it's very fast and it's kind of a return to basics. Because it's a lot of open strings and major pentatonic scales and open chords... And it's also a very festive kind of music genre. It's fun to play but it's also very fun to listen to.</q></p>
    <p><q>One of the set standards is called the <i>Beaumont Rag</i> and <b>de Beaumont</b> happens to be my last name so I decided to learn that one. And that one is tricky. It's a harder song to play but it's very fun.</q></p>

    <h2>The R&B touch... with <i>Paranoia Purple</i></h2>

    <p><q>My girlfriend Iulia and I are playing a song called <i>Paranoia Purple</i>, by <i>Yebba</i>, on the setlist. I had met Iulia in the Valencia semester... and that's a very pretty song and it's more oriented to the style she likes which is more R&B.</q></p>
    <p><q>I wanted to include that one... because Iulia has inspired me to be a better person here at Berklee and just in life, and also she's had a big influence on me, and that's why I wanted to include that.</q></p>
